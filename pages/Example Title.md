<p>Gone are the days when the government would use the snail mail method
to deliver paper vouchers or cheques for the purpose of payout disbursement.
Not only was the delivery process slow, but the letters would also at times
get lost. Thanks to Singaporeans' widespread adoption of the government's
digital apps, it has become possible for us to introduce GovWallet, a feature
allowing payouts and vouchers to be credited directly to your account for
a quicker and more secure delivery.</p>
<p>This digital wallet has been integrated with apps such as Singpass, LifeSG
and Healthy 365. It currently serves around 1.3 million citizens, who use
the credits to make purchases and transact with 164,000 merchants on the
PayNow platform as well as NETSâ€™ ecosystem of 43,000 merchants.</p>
