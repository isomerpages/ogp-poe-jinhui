<p>The objective of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) is to develop
a global network of conformity assessment bodies. This includes certification
bodies, testing and calibration laboratories, and inspection bodies, which
can be relied on to provide competent services, such as certification activities,
testing, calibration and inspection. Key to international trade, the MRAs
promote cross border stakeholder confidence and the acceptance of accredited
conformity assessment bodies.</p>

<h3>Benefit from MRAs?</h3>
<p>SAC's signatory status in the MRAs is a global passport for enterprises
in Singapore. There is no need for duplicative re-testing, re-inspection
or re-calibration of goods upon entry to importing countries. Moreover,
government agencies these days rely more on results from accredited facilities
as well as those of the MRA partners, as they begin to realise the credibility
of accreditation programmes that are based on internationally recognised
standards.</p>
<h3>How do MRAs work?</h3>
<p>An MRA is based on the results of intensive peer evaluation of its signatories.
The accreditation body to the MRA must agree to abide by the requirements
in ISO/IEC 17011: Conformity assessment - General Requirements for accreditation
bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies. They must ensure that
the conformity assessment bodies that they accredit conform to standards,
such as ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 15189 for laboratories, ISO/IEC 17020 for
inspection bodies, and ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17021 for accreditation
of certification bodies.</p>
<h3>How to Recognise Accredited Reports &amp; Certificates?</h3>
<p>Once a laboratory or inspection body becomes accredited, it is granted
exclusive use of the logo belonging to the particular accreditation body
that issued its accreditation. The accredited body can only refer to its
accreditation according to the respective tests, calibration or inspection.
For easier recognition across borders, the International Laboratory Accreditation
Cooperation (ILAC) has come up with an internationally recognised mark
called the ILAC mark. This is to be used alongside the logo of the accreditation
body. An example of how the ILAC mark is used by accredited laboratories
in Singapore is demonstrated below:</p>
