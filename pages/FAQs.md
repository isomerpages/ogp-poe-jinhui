<h1>What is Ramadan?</h1>
<p>Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims
worldwide. They abstain from food, drink, and other indulgences during
daylight hours, focusing on spiritual growth and acts of charity. This
period of self-discipline and empathy concludes with the celebration of
Hari Raya Puasa.</p>
