<p>Moonchild does have unique dishes, as well as classic items such as buttermilk
waffles and more. It doesn’t hurt that the space screams #aesthetic, and
is spaciously appointed so you won’t feel cramped even when it’s full.
We enjoyed the drinks and the potato stack, while the Asian-inspired dishes
weren’t too shabby—but our bill came up to almost $100.</p>
